# Laprovim
## Description
My own personal neovim configuration. I initially started by looking through [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/blob/master/init.lua) but I decided that I would rather just make this from scratch and pull from that repository for inspiration.
## TODO
- [ ] Obsidian nvim
    - I need to install and configure the Obsidian Nvim plugin
- [ ] Better git integration
    - I generally prefer to use git from the command line, but it would be nice to be able to view diffs and whatnot
- [ ] More language support
    - Right now I am using lots of powershell. It would be nice to build this in.
    - I would also like to build out a sort of "switch" system that will turn certain features on/off for different languages so that I do not have a bunch of them bloating everythin all of the time.
- [ ] LSP Support
- [ ] More keymaps
    - I really need some keymaps for looking through buffers and whatnot
